SUMMARY:The Mother Fuckin David Deery Show presents "NO DIGGITY!"

The stand up comedy show people call, "pretty darn good."

For those of you who missed the Nerd Circus, or Ticket to Mustache Ride, or whatever I called my two year birthday show,  I'm back, in a bigger, better, more "theater" like venue for my very special four year anniversary. 

What started out as ironic joke has turned into a full scale life of convincing people I'm worthy of five euros at a time to tell them about how much I love to suck on ladies breasts and how much I hate Spanish people with dreads in the back of their hair and so on and so forth.

THE MOTHER FUCKIN DAVID DEERY SHOW! 

This show, entitled NO DIGGITY will contain a lot of material from my last three shows, but may contain new material, but who gives a shit, tickets are five euros in advance and 7 euros at the door and I guarantee even if you already know the joke you will piss your pants laughing, or at least have fun, unless of course, you are Spanish and have dreads in the back of your head, in which case I make no such promises. 

You my Spanish friend, should get a haircut.  

I will be making hand made tickets available when I'm good and ready to make them available. 

Until then, enjoy the "summer" and see you in the kietz.

The Very Irreverend Sean Hunter Williams will perform a Debaptism on any who wish it, demanding that Jesu, Mohammed and Thor renounce any claims of ownership over the more ethereal aspects of your being, and freeing you at long last to pig-out in an orgee of liberal, loving, free-thinking, hedonistic whoredom... or to simply feel exactly how you felt before the influence of these magical, makey-uppy creatures was brought to an end. 

If you have no need of debaptism, you are welcome to just watch the show. There may be a little commentary from some of Berlin's finest comedians. And the big G himself has promised to put in an appearance. 

Drinks & divilment aplenty.

The culmination of ATHEIST Berlin's 3 day pop-up shop (<a rel="nowfollow" href="http://www.facebook.com/events/414337795279308/">facebook.com/events/414337795279308/</a>), this excommunicable extravaganza will be hosted by the delightful Mother Fucking David Deery, with additional venting by Drew Portnoy, Tim Whelan, Caroline Clifford, Nate Blachard, Marcel Mohab, Dharmander Singh, Naomi Fearn, Passun Ernseto Azhand and some agnostic bet-hedging from James Harris. 

Please arrive early, as space will be at a premium... especially if god puts in a surprise appearance.

Earlier in the week, on THURSDAY 26th, there will be a mass debaptism, from 20:00, conducted by the very Irreverend Sean Hunter Williams, with additional comic turns by Drew Portnoy, Paul Salamone & Katie Miranda. Any in need of purification are welcome.


Finally, from THURSDAY to SATURDAY, heathens are invited to try on the softest shoes ever created by man, allegedly akin to "walking on babies"... and to sip coffee or vodka with other godless wretches. The shop is open Thursday and Friday 14:00 to 22:00. And Saturday 12:00 to late. <!-- owner: 259051464181439 venue:  -->

"Will it be new Material?" You ask.

"Dumb question, asshole." I will answer sarcastically, but yes, it will be all new material and new videos and a brand new mustache.  

Come see the show the critics are calling "Pretty good." and do the proper thing for your artist karma and tell 5 friends about it who might not know.

Thank you and see you in the park, when you say hello to me even though I have no idea who you are. 

Love.

SUMMARY:"Ladies" Night, Neukölln
LOCATION:<a href="http://maps.google.de/maps?q=The Zone,+,+,+,+">MAP</a>

Our "all female" line up on Wednesday is hosted by the one and only Stephanie. Her dulcet tones and bristly manner have seduced man and woman alike over the years, and we are honoured to have her back in familiar territory down in The Craic Den.

Also appearing on the night are: 

The women of the Comedysportz improv crew. More information here

Summer Banks

Summer Banks ist Komikerin und Moderatorin Amerikanischer Herkunft und wohnt in Berlin seit 2008. Sie nutzt ihr tiefe Stimme und Abschluss in Philosophie für eine einzigartige Mischung von Sozial Kritik und purer Quatsch.
Born in the wilds of the California desert and eventually finding herself in the wilds of northern Germany, Summer Banks is a different sort of comedian. Her style is marked by cutting social commentary mixed with eye for the ridiculous.

Pip Swallow

Pip Swallow won the Annual Funniest Name in the World competition for 20 years in a row because, aside from the obvious, Pip apparently means blow job in Greek and French. She lost her title this year to the strong, Russian contender Houdou Nikabolokov. Although her pride has been dented she can be seen performing stand up and improvised comedy at the Craic Den. Please laugh when you hear her name.

Tamika Campbell

Naomi Fearn

Some very special, and gender boundary pushing guests.

And some wonderful music from Isobel Gibson Flader.

Many moons ago, Isobel ("le Renard") embarked upon a journey, leaving home carrying a rucksack, a small guitar, and a soul full of dreams. A series of winding roads led her to Berlin, a city which enabled her to manifest many of these dreams into reality. Among them was the desire to share her poetry and music while collaborating with others. These days you may find her rambling alongside the S-bahn tracks or howling into the city streets in the gathering dawn. If you encounter her on your comings and going through town, she will happily tell you a story or sing you a tune should you lend her your ears for a moment or two.

<a rel="nowfollow" href="http://www.soundcloud.com/lerenardjams">soundcloud.com/&hellip;</a>

As always with the Craic Den, you will get the chance to get intimate with the performers, your neighbours and of course, the floor. There are plenty of comfy couches and chairs, but we don't frown upon extreme levels of comfort, so by all means bring pillows, cushions, blankets, hot water bottles and any other devices of comfort you wish.

Watch this space, as there will be many interesting and exciting elements added to the event before we kick off on Wednesday.

We look forward to seeing you all down in The Craic Den on Wednesday night.

Love.
