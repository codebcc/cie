SUMMARY:Post Humor: Prime-time-ism
LOCATION: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/PostHumor">Post Humor</a> <a href="http://maps.google.de/maps?q=52.500189,+13.435586(Post Humor)">MAP</a>
DESCRIPTION:<a href='https://www.facebook.com/events/465708816783868' class='uibutton confirm'>Event on Facebook</a><br><br><img src="https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-ash4/592333_465708816783868_2011001633_s.jpg" alt="" class="img" />Post Humor explores the concept of "prime-time-ism" or, so it looks nicer as a word, primetimism. A little known comedic-historical term which encapsulates tendencies, attitudes, and desires for bright lights, large audiences, and "the big time". Is prime time TV dead? In a world where all your favorite shows are available at your convenience on the web, prime time TV remains popular, yet the usual time block which gave rise to the term (hours between 8pm and 10pm in most countries around the world) has lost some significance. 

In todays post primetime society, prime time is whenever you want, but what else is associated with prime time from the perspective of the artist? For many it means censorship, catering to a "lower culture" and "boiling things down", which might mean "acting out quotations marks with your hands" during dialogue. 

WELL NOT HERE! This shit is LIVE and uncensored! Raw, and presented AS prime time, DURING prime time! Turn off your TV's and come laugh your asses off! 

With sketches from:

Passun Azhand

Sean Williams

and Josh Telson

Second half of long-form improvised comedy with:

The Improv Amt

Musical Guest, and cast and crew TBA, stay tuned!
