Come see where jokes are born.

Unfortunately, this is also where many jokes will be put to death, compassionately of course. 

I will be focusing on writing some new material and inviting my friends along to do the same. 

THAT'S RIGHT! I HAVE FRIENDS!

Here's the lineup. 

MF David Deery (That's me!)
Paul Salamone (That's a friend)
Chris Davis (Another friend)
Sean Hunter Williams (Another friend, kind of)

THIS IS NOT THE PREMIER COMEDY SHOW IN BERLIN WITH THE BEST COMICS AND THE BEST BLAH BLAH BLAH. 

This is just some guys tryin to birth some laughs. 

Or not. You decide.

SUMMARY:Post Humor: Prime-time-ism
LOCATION: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/PostHumor">Post Humor</a> <a href="http://maps.google.de/maps?q=52.500189,+13.435586(Post Humor)">MAP</a>

A little known comedic-historical term which encapsulates tendencies, attitudes, and desires for bright lights, large audiences, and "the big time". Is prime time TV dead? In a world where all your favorite shows are available at your convenience on the web, prime time TV remains popular, yet the usual time block which gave rise to the term (hours between 8pm and 10pm in most countries around the world) has lost some significance. 

In today's post primetime society, prime time is whenever you want, but what else is associated with prime time from the perspective of the artist? For many it means censorship, catering to a "lower culture" and "boiling things down", which might mean "acting out quotations marks with your hands" during dialogue. 

WELL NOT HERE! This shit is LIVE and uncensored! Raw, and presented AS prime time, DURING prime time! Turn off your TVs and come laugh your asses off! 

With sketches from:

Passun Azhand  and Sean Williams featuring:

Caroline Clifford
Josh Telson
Georg Kammerer
Pip Swallow
Summer Banks
Noah Telson

Five comedians, two litres of Jameson Whiskey, and news topics from the last weeks. 

Join moderator Paul Salamone and guest panelists James Harris, Tim W-lan, Nate Blanchard and Andrew Reid for a live english-language comedy panel show where we discuss, laugh about, and fight over the news of the day - especially stories about Berlin. To make it more interesting, the show doesn't end until TWO bottles of Jameson's finest whiskey are consumed by the panel. In the second act we invite a special secret guest.

As an added bonus, our supporters Jameson Whiskey are kindly offering a delicious free whiskey and ginger ale to every attendee. As always in The Craic Den, we will have some wonderful live, and not so live music for your entertainment. 

Entry is just €4, and includes a Jameson Whiskey and ginger ale in order to allow you to empathise with the panellists!

A night of comedy, music and entertainment themed around the largest subject of all:

Life, the Universe and Everything!

Together we'll tackle the important questions:

Does Richard Dawkins really exist?
Do I exist?
Where can I take comfort? Religion? Atheism? Kinderschokolade?

In German there is the phrase "ueber Gott und die Welt" sprechen 
meaning to talk about everything and anything. I think of this as a tipsy pub conversation where the riddles of life are solved, only to be conveniently forgotten the next morning. And that's the goal for this evening. 

Performers: contact me if you want to have 5-10 minutes to present your ideas and creations - in song, poetry, prose or comedic form! 

There'll also be some open spots in the style of Speaker's Corner in Hyde park, for people to come up and share their ideas without judgement. (We'll be judging you).

Ideas and performances should range from the deeply meaningful, to the blitheringly absurd.

Line-up:

Comedy from:
James Harris
Dharmander Singh
Katie Maranda
Drew Portnoy
Tim W-lan

Poetry from James Harris                              
Free improvisation from duo Denitsa Mineva (acoustic violin) and Stephan Bleier (double bass)
