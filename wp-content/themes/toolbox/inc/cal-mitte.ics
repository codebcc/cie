Episodes One, Two and Three proved that when you mix accomplished live musicians, Berlin's best English-speaking comedians, danceable tunes and some friendly people- in a Bowl- beauty and madness are the inevitable result.

Presented by Chris Glen and Neil Numb, The Fish Bowl is held every fortnight and plays host to:

Live Music
English-Language Comedy
and a DJ Afterparty

THIS WEEK music will be shared by Rob Longstaff, Tim Whelan, Bruce Miller and Mike Richards. Comedy will be provided in the form of Katie Maranda, James Harris and Tamika Campbell(more to be announced). The after party will be taken care of by DJ Schaefchen.

ALSO.... It's only Neil Numb's bloody birthday! I think you know that means :)
