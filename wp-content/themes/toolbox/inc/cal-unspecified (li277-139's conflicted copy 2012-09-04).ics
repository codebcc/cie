SUMMARY:The Mother Fuckin David Deery Show presents "NO DIGGITY!"
LOCATION:<a href="http://maps.google.de/maps?q=Villa Neukölln, Hermannstraße 233, 12049 Berlin, Germany (U 8 Boddinstraße),+,+,+,+">MAP</a>
DESCRIPTION:<a href='https://www.facebook.com/events/341184252617563' class='uibutton confirm'>Event on Facebook</a><br><br><img src="https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-snc6/276849_341184252617563_1782509153_s.jpg" alt="" class="img" />THIS IS IT Y'ALL! 

The stand up comedy show people call, "pretty darn good."

For those of you who missed the Nerd Circus, or Ticket to Mustache Ride, or whatever I called my two year birthday show,  I'm back, in a bigger, better, more "theater" like venue for my very special four year anniversary. 

What started out as ironic joke has turned into a full scale life of convincing people I'm worthy of five euros at a time to tell them about how much I love to suck on ladies breasts and how much I hate Spanish people with dreads in the back of their hair and so on and so forth.

THE MOTHER FUCKIN DAVID DEERY SHOW! 

This show, entitled NO DIGGITY will contain a lot of material from my last three shows, but may contain new material, but who gives a shit, tickets are five euros in advance and 7 euros at the door and I guarantee even if you already know the joke you will piss your pants laughing, or at least have fun, unless of course, you are Spanish and have dreads in the back of your head, in which case I make no such promises. 

You my Spanish friend, should get a haircut.  

I will be making hand made tickets available when I'm good and ready to make them available. 

Until then, enjoy the "summer" and see you in the kietz.
