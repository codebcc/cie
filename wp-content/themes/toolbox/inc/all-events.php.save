Comedy will be provided in the form of Katie Maranda(U.S), James Harris(U.K), Barry MacEoin(IRE) and Tamika Campbell(U.S.), . The after party will be taken care of by DJ Schaefchen.\n\nALSO....

In a world where all your favorite shows are available at your convenience on the web, prime time TV remains popular, yet the usual time block which gave rise to the term (hours between 8pm and 10pm in most countries around the world) has lost some significance. \n\nIn today's post primetime society, prime time is whenever you want, but what else is associated with prime time from the perspective of the artist?

Religion? Atheism? Kinderschokolade?\n\nIn German there is the phrase \"ueber Gott und die Welt\" sprechen \nmeaning to talk about everything and anything. I think of this as a tipsy pub conversation where the riddles of life are solved, only to be conveniently forgotten the next morning. And that's the goal for this evening. \n\nPerformers: contact me if you want to have 5-10 minutes to present your ideas and creations - in song, poetry, prose or comedic form! \n\nThere'll also be some open spots in the style of Speaker's Corner in Hyde park, for people to come up and share their ideas without judgement.

Comedy will be provided in the form of Katie Maranda(U.S), James Harris(U.K), Barry MacEoin(IRE) and Tamika Campbell(U.S.), . The after party will be taken care of by DJ Schaefchen.\n\nALSO.... It's only Neil \u201ccomedy host\u201d Numb's birthday! So, we'll be cranking the party up a notch and giving him a good roasting from an old friend via our live video link-up.

Her style is marked by cutting social commentary mixed with eye for the ridiculous.\nhttp:\/\/jokeofthedayberlin.tumblr.com\/\n\nPip Swallow\n\nPip Swallow won the Annual Funniest Name in the World competition for 20 years in a row because, aside from the obvious, Pip apparently means blow job in Greek and French. She lost her title this year to the strong, Russian contender Houdou Nikabolokov. Although her pride has been dented she can be seen performing stand up and improvised comedy at the Craic Den. Please laugh when you hear her name.\n\nTamika Campbell\n\nNaomi Fearn\n\nSome very special, and gender boundary pushing guests.\n\nAnd some wonderful music from Isobel Gibson Flader.\n\nMany moons ago, Isobel (\"le Renard\") embarked upon a journey, leaving home carrying a rucksack, a small guitar, and a soul full of dreams. A series of winding roads led her to Berlin, a city which enabled her to manifest many of these dreams into reality. Among them was the desire to share her poetry and music while collaborating with others. These days you may find her rambling alongside the S-bahn tracks or howling into the city streets in the gathering dawn. If you encounter her on your comings and going through town, she will happily tell you a story or sing you a tune should you lend her your ears for a moment or two.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.soundcloud.com\/lerenardjams\n\nAs always with the Craic Den, you will get the chance to get intimate with the performers, your neighbours and of course, the floor.

A series of winding roads led her to Berlin, a city which enabled her to manifest many of these dreams into reality. Among them was the desire to share her poetry and music while collaborating with others.

Please laugh when you hear her name.\n\nTamika Campbell\n\nNaomi Fearn\n\nSome very special, and gender boundary pushing guests.\n\nAnd some wonderful music from Isobel Gibson Flader.\n\nMany moons ago, Isobel (\"le Renard\") embarked upon a journey, leaving home carrying a rucksack, a small guitar, and a soul full of dreams. A series of winding roads led her to Berlin, a city which enabled her to manifest many of these dreams into reality. Among them was the desire to share her poetry and music while collaborating with others. These days you may find her rambling alongside the S-bahn tracks or howling into the city streets in the gathering dawn. If you encounter her on your comings and going through town, she will happily tell you a story or sing you a tune should you lend her your ears for a moment or two.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.soundcloud.com\/lerenardjams\n\nAs always with the Craic Den, you will get the chance to get intimate with the performers, your neighbours and of course, the floor.
